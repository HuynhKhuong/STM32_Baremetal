Due to distinction between STM32F4 and STM32F1 architecture, I created a new project which makes use of F1 layers and adapt the F4 hardware architecture.

The target of this project is to manipulate fundamental peripherals of STM32F4 MCU (STM32F407VGT6 specifically) as well as to build my own SW architecture, inspired by AUTOSAR architecture & Bosch architecture.
