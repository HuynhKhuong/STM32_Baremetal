Due to distinction between STM32F4 and STM32F1 architecture, I created a new project which makes use of F1 layers and adapt the F4 hardware architecture.

Th4 -=44arget of this project is to manipulate fundamental peripherals of STM32F4 MCU (STM32F407VGT6 specifically) as well as to build my own SW architecture, inspired by AUTOSAR architecture & Bosch architecture.
