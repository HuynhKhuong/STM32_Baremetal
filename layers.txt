layers:

1. Application using abstract functions
2. Abstract functions for peripherals manipulation
3. Data & Command abstraction (via enums, macros, structs)
4. Interrupt handling (bare metal)
5. Low-layer configuration (bare metal) 


A struct for a peripheral: PORT, function pointer,.....
-> Layers would take infor from struct 
struct between layers communicate with each other via index
