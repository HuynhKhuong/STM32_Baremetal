  *         CMSIS Cortex-M3 Device Peripheral Access Layer Header File. 
  *          This file contains all the peripheral register's definitions, bits 
  *          definitions and memory mapping for STM32F10x Connectivity line, 
  *          High density, High density value line, Medium density, 
  *          Medium density Value line, Low density, Low density Value line 
  *          and XL-density devices.
  *
  *          The file is the unique include file that the application programmer
  *          is using in the C source code, usually in main.c. This file contains:
  *           - Configuration section that allows to select:
  *              - The device used in the target application
  *              - To use or not the peripheral’s drivers in application code(i.e. 
  *                code will be based on direct access to peripheral’s registers 
  *                rather than drivers API), this option is controlled by 
  *                "#define USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER"
  *              - To change few application-specific parameters such as the HSE 
  *                crystal frequency
  *           - Data structures and the address mapping for all peripherals
  *           - Peripheral's registers declarations and bits definition
  *           - Macros to access peripheral’s registers hardware
