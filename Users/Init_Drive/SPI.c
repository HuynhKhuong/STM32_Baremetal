    Master transmit sequence:
    - The transmit sequence begins when a byte is written in the Tx Buffer.
    - The data byte is parallel-loaded into the shift register (from the internal bus) 
    - During the first bit transmission and then shifted out serially to the MOSI pin MSB first or LSB first
    - The TXE flag is set on the transfer of data from the Tx Buffer to the shift register 
    - The TXE flag is set off when Tx Buffer is written with data

    Software has to follow this procedure for transmitting data:
    1. Enable the SPI by setting the SPE bit to 1.
    2. Write the first data item to be transmitted into the SPI_DR register (this clears the TXE
    flag).
    3. Wait until TXE=1 and write the second data item to be transmitted. Then wait until
    RXNE=1 and read the SPI_DR to get the first received data item (this clears the RXNE
    bit). Repeat this operation for each data item to be transmitted/received until the nâ€“1
    received data.
    4. Wait until RXNE=1 and read the last received data.
    5. Wait until TXE=1 and then wait until BSY=0 before disabling the SPI.
